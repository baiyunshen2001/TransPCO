    "We used a real gene module having 263 genes from the ODE dataset in our simulations. The correlation matrix for these 263 genes is denoted as $\\Sigma_{263}$. To generate Z scores for 263 SNPs under the null hypothesis, we modeled them as $Z_{null} \\sim N(0,\\Sigma_{263})$. Our simulations aimed to evaluate the statistical power of trans-PCO, a univariate test (MinP) and a principal component-based test (PC1)."

    "To assess the performance of three statistical tests across different genetic architectures, we conducted simulations with varying sample sizes. The sample sizes examined were 200, 400, 600, and 800. We maintained a significance level equivalent to a 10% False Discovery Rate (FDR) to align with standard practices in real data analysis. Power was calculated as the average proportion of tests that were deemed significant out of 10000 simulated SNPs, repeated across 100 simulations. A test result was considered significant if its adjusted p-value was less than 0.1."
